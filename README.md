# GRC Playground

**The sandbox for GRC pros to break things, test ideas, and learn by doing.**

Welcome to the GRC Playground! A space built for GRC folks who are tired of reading 500-page PDFs and want to actually do the thing. No more theory with no application. No more guessing how policy as code works. Just hands-on labs designed to teach you how to turn frameworks into something real.

This isn't your typical GRC content. We don’t do boring here.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to build and test real security controls  
- How tools like Conftest, Rego, and Trivy work in practice  
- How to use policy as code, CI/CD, and automation to reduce manual compliance work  
- How to actually map controls to technical implementations  
- How to stop saying “it depends” and start showing your work

---

## Who This Is For

- GRC pros who want to get more technical  
- Cybersecurity analysts who want to understand the “G” and “R” in GRC  
- Engineers who are being told to meet compliance requirements but don’t know what that means  
- Anyone who's been stuck Googling “how to policy-as-code” and ended up in a 40-tab rabbit hole  
- People who learn best by doing, not just by reading

## Labs

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Lab 01 – Deny Public S3 Buckets](./Policy-as-Code/Lab%2001-Deny-Public-S3) | Write a policy using Rego and Conftest to prevent public S3 buckets |
| [Lab 01 – Control Mapping for Beginners](./Control-Mapping/Lab%2001-Control-Mapping-for-Beginners) | Learn how to map NIST 800-53 controls to your DevSecOps pipeline |

More labs are in the works:  
Policy as Code, Continuous Monitoring, Evidence Automation, and anything else GRC needs but never gets taught.

## Start Here

New to GitHub? You’re not alone, and you’re not too late. Most GRC professionals weren’t handed a GitHub 101 course during onboarding. I get it.

### How to navigate this repo:
1. Scroll up to the **Labs** section.
2. Click any lab title to open the folder.
3. Inside each folder, open the `README.md` for step-by-step instructions.
4. Most labs run entirely in your browser using GitHub Codespaces. That means: no installs, no local setup, no excuses.

## 👋 Who Made This?

I’m a GRC nerd turned lab builder who got tired of seeing smart people struggle because no one showed them how this stuff actually works.

If you’re ready to move from checklist zombie to hands-on GRC wizard, you’re in the right place.

Follow along [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-pearce) or contribute your own ideas for what we should build next.
